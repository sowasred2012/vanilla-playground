# Vanilla Playground

A tiny project that includes [Vanilla](https://github.com/canonical-web-and-design/vanilla-framework/), along with [sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass).

It has one script that watches for changes in the /src/scss directory and compiles the files there to CSS:

```
npm run watch:sass
```
